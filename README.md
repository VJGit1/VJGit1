### 🧬 what keeps me coding at 2am

- extracting meaning from messy language data (NLP ftw)  
- understanding how LLMs “think” and how GenAI can be made safer and more useful  
- exploring the real-world implications of bias, explainability, and evaluation in ML  
- building with purpose — whether it’s a predictive model or a playful experiment  
- debugging code like it's a boss fight 💥

---

### 🧠 current obsessions

- 🤖 fine-tuning transformer models for classification & generation  
- ✨ vector databases, embeddings, and RAG pipelines  
- 🧩 genAI agents and multi-modal workflows  
- 📈 ML pipeline design, tuning, and evaluation  
- 🔍 experimenting with prompt engineering + few-shot learning
